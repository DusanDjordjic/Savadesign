It is constantly in use (and testing) and constantly in development. At the moment it has over 130 commands, from simple automation 'scripts' to very complex tools, all made for the increase in the efficiency and reducing number of errors in everyday tasks in the ship design office.\nToolbox contains over 130 tools in the working environment of rhinoceros 3D:\n- 3D modeling\n- Class documentation (2D drawings)\n- Workshop documentation (2D drawings)\n- Workshop production information (cutting files, profile sketches, templates)\n\n SD_NAUTILUS is based on the platform of rhinoceros 3DÂ® for many reasons:\n- Rhino offers great tools, simple interface and full freedom od 3D modeling at affordable price.\n- Rhino is used by naval architects worldwide and has been established in the world of naval architecture as one of the essential tools.\n- Naval architecture students all over the world learn rhinoceros during their studies, so training costs for new people working in rhino is greatly reduced.",

But non-existence of the 'intelligence' and the database is also a drawback that makes working on large scale projects challenging.\n\nSD_NAUTILUS closes the complete shipbuilding lifecycle, from design to production, everything inside rhino.",

        text: "# Basics\nAlthough SD_NAUTILUS covers wide scope of tools, the most powerful tools are in the processing of the 3D model.\n\nTools like:\n- positioner\n-  mat. spec creator,\n- part extractor and \n- 2D section creator \n\nsignificantly increase the efficiency of creating class and workshop documentation. These tools are actually 'post-processor' type of tools - they start form the 3D model and create 'output' from it, more or less automatically.\n\nFor 'post-processing' of the model, the 3D model can be created even without the plugin itself, and without any conversions later on.  of course, some modeling 'Guidelines' must be followed in order to make the 3D model compatible with the plugin.  By using the built-in rhino worksession tools, modeling work can be spread to multiple workstations, which significantly shortens the time needed to get 3D model ready and with model ready, the real power of SD_NAUTILUS comes to surface.\n## How it works\n3D model is the central part of the SD_NAUTILUS.  \nTherefore, keeping 3D model accurate, clean and up-to-date is the essential for the efficient usage of the plugin.  \nFor any rhino 3D model to be used with SD_NAUTILUS, it has to fulfill the following:  \n- All objects must be valid solid objects  \n- Simple conventions must be followed for layer naming",
